# ImageMemorability
This repository contains the final project for the CS 577 Deep Learning course at the IIT, which consits of a neural network model for predicting image memorability.

### Data
For the purpose of this project the LaMem data set has been selected. This data set consists of 60,000 images, each one associated with a normalized memorability score. This data can be download in the LaMem site:\
http://memorability.csail.mit.edu/download.html

## Train the model
1. Clone the repository:\
`git clone https://github.com/esolis14/ImageMemorability`

2. Dowload the dataset and extract it:\
`wget http://memorability.csail.mit.edu/lamem.tar.gz`

3. Change the relative paths to the .txt and images.

4. Run the jupyter notebook.
